# Application of Network Policy in a Multicloud Environment

The application of network policy in a multicloud environment is significantly different than when network policy is applied to a single Kubernetes cluster.  This directory and its sub-directories will provide a complete understanding of network policy application in a multicloud environment.

Topics covered:

* A short introduction to network policy and some of the different variants

* Discussion of the networking aspects that affect network policy behavior and capabilities

* A contrast of network policy capabilities in a single cloud environment versus a multicloud environment

* Enumeration of additional work or functionality that could be added to improve the behavior

* Differences in behavior based on the environment hosting the Kubernetes cluster

* Test results from different use cases

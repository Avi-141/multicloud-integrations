# Cisco CloudCenter

This section will provide steps to stand up a CloudCenter in the target cloud environment in support of the PetClinic and related lab exercises.

* Thorough installation instructions can be found on the [CloudCenter website](https://docs.cloudcenter.cisco.com/display/CCD482/Virtual+Appliance+Overview)

* For this lab, 4.9.0 is the supported release. Use the files referenced in the downloads section at the beginning of this document for the current version.
  
* The lab does not require High availability or load balanced configuration. Those aspects of the installation guide can be skipped.
  
* The installation is organized by component. The approach is well documented within the installation guide.
  
* Once the installation of CloudCenter is complete, verify access into the CloudCenter user interface.
